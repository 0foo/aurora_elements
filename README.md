# Elements to extend the Aurora Builder

This content can be placed in the custom folder of the character builder. Alternatively, and recommended, you can 'fetch' the URL of the raw core.index file (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aurorabuilder/elements/master/core.index) in the 'custom content' tab to let the builder do the work for you. The same applies to the supplements.index, third-party.index, and the unearthed-arcana.index.

When the content here gets updated you can use the 'check for updates' button to pull down the latest version of the files.
