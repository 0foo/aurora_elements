			<p>Spiritualists truck with restless spirits and wield psychic powers. Having survived a brush with death, spiritualists discover that not only can they sense the presence of the restless dead, they can also channel them. The forgotten promise they made while on death's door allows them to cast spells that manipulate the emotions and senses of others, as well as exert their will over life and death.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Breathing deeply as wisps of incense rise around her, a human focuses her will on the mystical bonds that tie the objects in her hands to the person who once owned them. As she inhales, her eyes roll back and her eyelids flutter while her mind fills with a vision of a far away place. Through the haze, she sees the young half-dwarf she was searching for and the filthy tavern room he was hiding in.</p>
			<p class="indent">A halfling watches intently as the planchette moves across the board, hovering over one letter after another. As the letters string together into a name, the identity of the murder she’s been chasing reveals itself and she raises one hand to her mouth in horror.</p>
			<p class="indent">Stopping suddenly, a lemurian listens intently to a sound no of his companions heard. Something had followed him back from the Ethereal Plane. Something too dangerous to leave be. He turns quickly, making a sign of exorcism in the air while walking towards the dark presence.</p>
			<p class="indent">Spiritualists are mediums, bridging the worlds of the living and the dead. Having barely escaped an encounter with death themselves, spiritualists commune with restless spirits for mystical power. They use their spells and occult talents to ensure their second chance at life isn’t wasted.</p>
			<h4>Brush With Death</h4>
			<p>Not everyone who has a near death experience becomes a spiritualist but all spiritualists have survived an encounter that brought them to the brink of death. Spiritualists remember the specifics of the event unclearly. They often recall an ominous figure stepping out from the darkness offering an extension on their lives but further details, such as the cost of the favor, elude them. This incident was the catalyst for the acquisition of their occult powers, from spellcasting to communing with the dead to seeing beyond the borders of the physical realm.</p>
			<p class="indent">The specific circumstances of a spiritualist’s brush with death leaves a permanent impression on them. Those who survive the attack of a wild beast find they have the ability to command such predators following the experience. Spiritualists that survive a potentially fatal illness discover they can withstand diseases and toxins that would have previously been lethal.</p>
			<h4>Beyond the Veil</h4>
			<p>Before they can see spirits, spiritualists can sense them. In the presence of ethereal beings the hair on the back of their necks will stand up or they’ll get a splitting migraine or they hear the sound of a river rushing when none is nearby. Soon after they learn to beckon spirits to the share their minds and bodies. Then at last the spiritualist’s eyes open to the world they already knew existed, the world of spirits that coexists alongside the physical realm.</p>
			<p class="indent">Novice spiritualists quickly discover that, while the world is full of dead people, they tend to attract a certain type. The reason for this isn’t precisely known, but among themselves spiritualists believe that the kinds of spirits they resonate with are representative of the spiritualist’s own repressed or unexpressed emotions.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A SPIRITUALIST</h4>
			<p>Spiritualists are torn between the worlds of the living and the dead. As you create your spiritualist character, the most important question to consider is: how do you see your role as a medium between these two worlds? Are your abilities the unwanted repercussions of a traumatic experience you’ll never forget? Did the instance of your brush with death mark the start of a new and better life for you? Do you wish you could turn your senses away from the spirits of the departed? Did your awareness of the ethereal realm bring about an unexpected reunion with someone you lost?</p>
			<p class="indent">Spiritualists are further defined by the circumstances of their near death experience and the spirits they most frequently contact. Were you the child of a minor noble, targeted for assassination as a way of intimidating the upper class? Did you grow up in a rural village only to find that one year a plague swept through and only you survived? Were you traveling from one city to the next when a pack of wolves set upon you and your caravan and nearly took your life? The moment you came within a breath of dying, but didn’t, you became a spiritualist.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a spiritualist, the unquiet dead seek you out, pleading for you to intervene on their behalf. What kind of requests are you most sympathetic to? Has a spirit ever asked you to do something you were unwilling to do? Have you ever agreed to help a spirit and later regretted it? Do you feel greater responsibility to the dead or the living? Are the spirits of the departed tools to use for your own gain or companions in their own right?</p>
			<p class="indent">The answer to these questions will define you as a spiritualist.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a spiritualist quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity or Constitution. Second, choose the acolyte, charlatan, or hermit background.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Your ability to pierce the veil that separates the living from the dead grants you the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 of the Player’s Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and this document for the spiritualist spell list.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Cantrips</h5>
			<p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the spiritualist spell list. You learn additional spiritualist cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Spiritualist table.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>
			<p>The Spiritualist table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your spiritualist spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">You prepare the list of spiritualist spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the spiritualist spell list. When you do so, choose a number of spiritualist spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your spiritualist level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell forsaken chains, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of spiritualist spells required time spent in meditation and communion with the spirits of the departed: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Spellcasting Ability</h5>
			<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for spiritualist spells. Your ability to call out to the unquiet dead and reach into the minds of the living comes from a powerful sense of self. You use your Charisma whenever a spiritualist spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spiritualist spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
			</center>
			<h5 class="caption">Ritual Casting</h5>
			<p>You can cast a spiritualist spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Spellcasting Focus</h5>
			<p>You can use a crystal, reliquary, spirit board, or totem (see chapter 5, “Equipment”, of the Player’s Handbook) as a spellcasting focus for your spiritualist spells.</p>
			<div class="sidebar">
				<h5>SPIRIT BOARDS</h5>
				<p>A spirit board consists of a planchette and small board or tablet, often made from paper and laminated to wood, that is decorated with letters and numbers. People use spirit boards to attempt to communicate with the dead by asking a question outloud and touching the planchette lightly, believing that unquiet spirits will use the planchette to spell out answers to the petitioner’s questions. Spiritualists can use spirit boards as a spellcasting focus. Spirits boards costs 3 sp and weigh 1 lb.</p>

			<p>Your connection to death allows you to channel the restless spirits of the dead. While channeling these spirits you remain in control of your behavior and actions. In exchange for the vicarious experience of living once more, the spirit lends you a portion of its mystical power.</p>
			<p class="indent">At 2nd level, you know one spirit. You can perform a 10 minute ritual to channel a spirit you know. The spirit remains channeled until you go unconscious, use an action to dismiss it, or perform this ritual again. When you gain certain spiritualist levels, you come to know additional spirits of your choice, as shown in the Spirits Known column of the Spiritualist table.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the spirits you know and replace it with another spirit.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Starting at 2nd level, you learn to manipulate the invisible and ethereal energy of death, ectoplasm. Your access to this substance is represented by a number of ectoplasm points. Your spiritualist level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ectoplasm Points column of the Spiritualist table.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can spend these points to activate certain spiritualist features, most of which are dependent on the spirit you have channeled. Additionally, you can use a bonus action on your turn to convert your ectoplasm points into additional Spell Slots. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create spell slots up to the level than you can cast with your Pact Magic. You lose unused spell slots created in this way when you take a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you spend an ectoplasm point, it is unavailable until you finish a long rest, at the end of which you regain all of your expended ectoplasm.</p>
